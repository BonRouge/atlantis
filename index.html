		 <p>Technology will also make our lives more fun and convenient. The walls of our homes will be like tablets. We will be able to download movies and play them on any wall. If we find a movie boring, we will be able to change the faces of the actors into our faces. </p>

  <p>Cars will drive by themselves. They will use GPS, and traffic accidents will decrease. These cars will be very useful for old people and the blind. The cars will drive them to the  supermarket or to the hospital.</p>

		<p>Technology will improve our health too, and we will be able to live longer. The scientist Michio Kaku thinks that our toilets will become our doctors. He says that toilets will be able to check our urine and warn us about future health problems, such as cancer. Also, we will be able to scan our DNA and know everything about our bodies. Doctors and scientists believe this information will prevent diseases.</p>

  <p>Doctors also hope that we will be able to make arms and legs with 3D printers. By the year 2030, we might not have the Paralympics anymore. We might also be able to make complex organs, such as hearts, and this will save lives. And with new technology, some scientists think that we will not get old anymore. According to them, people might live 1,000 years or more.</p>

		 <p>But is all this technology good for us? Some people say no. For example, some Japanese people are forgetting how to write Chinese characters because computers and smartphones can convert hiragana into kanji. </p>

  <p>Internet glasses might become our translators, but this means that fewer people will learn other languages. Foreign languages are not only for communication. They also teach us new things and different ways of thinking. </p>

  <p>Also, some people worry that overpopulation will become a big problem. This might make life very difficult for all of us. What do you think?</p>

		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>	I use e-mail every day.  It’s very convenient.  But sometimes, I think that e-mail isn’t good.  Before we had e-mail, we made phone calls.  We had to speak clearly, listen well, and respond quickly.  A clear voice, good listening ability, and a quick response are very important for good communication, both privately and professionally.  But with e-mail, we don’t have to speak clearly or listen well, and we can think for a long time.  Thus, many people can’t communicate well.  What do you think?

	<h2>Lesson 2: American Music - Blues, Jazz, and Hip Hop</h2>

		<div class="p1">
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p>When people think of American music, they usually think of rock and roll.  But to understand American music, you must begin at its origin, the blues.  The blues was the music of 19th century black field workers.  It used African melodies and rhythms.</p>
		<p>
	When you say, “I have the blues,” it means you are sad, lonely, and hurt.  You lose your job.  Your partner leaves you.  A family member dies.  Blues music is a way to express these painful emotions.
	</p>
		
		
		</div>
		
		<div class="p2">
		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<p>	A great blues musician was Robert Johnson, a poor black man from Mississippi.  After his young wife died, Johnson traveled around the American South and sang the blues.  
</p>
		
		<p>	For Johnson, it was important to become rich.  But he wasn’t a good musician.  He couldn’t sing or play the guitar well, and people laughed at him.  Then, one day, he disappeared for a few months.  When he came back, he was a great blues singer and guitarist.  Nobody could explain it.  So people thought that Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil.  In return, the Devil gave him the talent to be a blues musician.
</p>
		
		<p>	Johnson died in 1938 at the age of 27.  Since then, many musicians, such as 60s rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, died at the same age.  Some people think this is the curse of Robert Johnson.  
</p>

<!--<a class="outLink radius5" href="https://youtu.be/Kxi4XkIVWLQ">&gt; &gt; Listen to "Crossroads Blues" by Robert Johnson on YouTube &lt; &lt; </a>-->

		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p>	Jazz came from blues.  It uses similar melodies and rhythms.  Jazz is the story of human cooperation and creativity.  Americans worked  together to create great things, in life and in music.　
	
	  
</p>
		
		<p>The father of jazz is Louis Armstrong.  He once said that if you start to tap your foot, it means that the music is good.  Armstrong was born in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz.  His family was very poor, and he     got in trouble with the police.  At the age of eleven, he quit school.  But soon, he began to play the trumpet and sing.  By 1929, at the age of 28, Armstrong was a famous jazz musician.  He toured America and Europe.  </p>
		
		<p>Later, he became America’s goodwill ambassador.  He traveled to many countries and met important people.  His dream was to bring love and happiness to the world.</p>

		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>	Hip hop started in the 1960s in the poor black 
neighborhoods of New York City.  MCing (rapping), DJing (record  scratching), break dancing, and graffiti writing are the four elements of hip hop.  At first, DJs, such as DJ Kool Herc, one of the fathers of hip hop, liked playing short instrumental songs at parties.  Then, the DJs started reading poetry over these songs, and rapping was born.  
 </p>
 

		 <a class="outLink" a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pUowAaap3I">&gt;&gt; Watch a short YouTube video about DJ Kool Herc and the start of hip hop &lt;&lt;</a>
 
 

		
		<p>Hip hop songs often talk about the hard life of black people.  Gangs, racism, and police violence against blacks are common topics.  But hip hop songs also talk about peace, love, and accepting other cultures.</p>
		
		<p>	Hip hop had a humble origin.  But because of the strength and   creativity of black Americans, it now affects fashion, art, dance, and music around the world. </p>

		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>In the early days, life was very hard for black  musicians in America.  Black jazz bands were the best.  White people wanted to dance to their music.  So black bands played at very nice hotels in big cities.  However, the musicians of those bands could not stay at those hotels or enter through the main entrance.  When black bands toured in the American South, some restaurants refused to serve the musicians.  Many times, there was police violence against black musicians, such as Miles Davis.

		<p>	There are two countries which have a lot of influence around the world.  Some people think that the 21st century will be the “Chinese    century.”  What happens in China affects other countries.  Thanks to its many workers and natural resources, China’s economy is now number one in the world.  It overtook the United States in 2014, and experts say that by 2019, the Chinese economy will be 20 percent bigger than the US      economy.

		<p>China is also one of the top countries that writes scientific         research papers in English.  In 2003, China became the third country to              independently send a man into space.  But China also has many issues, such as the environment, media censorship, and human rights.

		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p>	America is the land of diversity.  Whites, blacks, Asians, and Latinos all live together.  There are Christians, Jews, atheists, and many other      religions and cultures.  America is home to all, and every group is equally American.  Diversity is what makes America great.  It brings different ways of thinking, many opinions, and new ideas.  This is very important for     debate and creativity. </p>

		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>	Can Japan be a world leader in the 21st century?  Can it overcome an aging population, a low birthrate, and few natural resources?  And how does Japan’s English skill compare to that of other countries?  In 1998, Japan was number two in the world for English research papers.  In 2008, China was number two.  Also, in        business, there is growing competition from other Asian countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan.
	</p>
		
		<p>Japanese people work very hard.  But is that enough in the 21st    century?  Japan needs creativity - people willing to think outside the box.   Japanese companies must make new and useful products people around the world need.  Most importantly, Japan must give its young people a bright     future through a practical education and through good, full time jobs.

		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>	I moved from America to Japan in 2000.  I enjoy the beautiful     nature of the country, the culture, and the high standard of living.  But what I really like about Japan is safety.  When I first came here from America, I was really impressed with how safe Japan was.  America can be a very  dangerous country, so it was great to walk around at night in a big city like  Tokyo and not have to worry.  That was a long time ago, and some people say that Japan is not so safe anymore.  But it’s still much safer than most countries in the world.  I think that safety is the best thing about Japan.

	<h2>Lesson 4: Vacation Nightmares</h2>

		<div class="p1">
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p>	People love vacations, especially when they go abroad.  It’s exciting to travel to other countries, see interesting things, and learn about different cultures.</p>
		
		<p>
	But some vacations become nightmares.  Pickpockets can take your money, camera, and passport.  People get sick because the food is spoiled or the water is contaminated.  And sometimes, even worse things happen.  You are about to read three nightmare vacation stories.  Pay attention so that these awful things don’t happen to you.
</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p2">
		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<p>Last year, my husband and I went to Europe on vacation.  We    were walking back to our hotel one day when we saw a sign that said, “Watch out for pickpockets!”  Instinctively, we checked our backpacks to make sure our wallets were there.  They were. </p>
		
		<p>
	A minute later, three girls came up to us.  They showed us               a clipboard, gesturing that they were mute.  They wanted us to sign a      petition for a charity.  We felt sorry for them, so we signed it.  They smiled and walked away.  But after a few minutes, we realized that our wallets were gone.  We looked at each other in horror.</p>
		
		<p>  
	“Was it the girls?”  “I don’t think so.  I think someone else did it, maybe when we signed the petition.”  “But how did they know that our wallets were in our backpacks?”  Then it hit us.  It was the “Watch out for  pickpockets!” sign.  When people see it, they instinctively check their    wallets.  The pickpockets wait there, watching carefully.  Then, they know where to strike.</p>
		
		<p>  	
	Though we didn’t lose much money, we had to cancel all our credit cards.  It was a huge hassle.

		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p>	In 2014, I visited South East Asia.  I knew that drinking tap water was dangerous there, so I was careful about that.</p>
		
		<p>
	On the last day of my trip, I went to a beautiful resort island.      Buying some souvenirs, I started having a bad stomachache.  Then, red marks appeared on my arms.  Seeing this, I started to panic, so I went to the hospital right away.</p>
		
		<p>  
	“Did you drink any tap water?” asked the doctor.  “No, I just had some iced tea,” I said.  “And where did the ice come from?” he asked.</p>
		
		<p>
	Having to stay in the hospital, I got back home three days late.  My boss was very angry with me for missing work. 
</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p4">
		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>I went to Latin America to see the ancient cities of the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans.  I was coming out of the airport when a man spoke to me.  “Are you Japanese?” he asked.  “Yes, I am,” I said.  He said that he liked Japan very much.  Then, he asked about my hotel.  I said that I was staying near the city center.  “I’m going that way, too,” he said.  “Let’s take the train together.”  I said O.K., and we left.  </p>
		
		<p>
	Getting off at the same station, we started walking to my hotel.  As we walked by a convenience store, he said he wanted something cold to drink.  There were tables outside, and he told me to wait there.  He came back with two cups of soda, and we sat talking.  But soon, I became sleepy, and I began mumbling.  Then, I passed out.  When I woke up, the man was gone, as were all my bags and money.  He took everything I had.</p>
		
		<p>
	Later, the police said the man drugged me.  For hours, I kept     looking through mug shots trying to identify him.  What a terrible           experience!

		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>	Sometimes, a vacation nightmare can have a happy ending.  A friend told me a story about her niece.  The young woman was stuck in the airport in Chicago because of a terror alert.  No flights were coming or   going.  The only way out was by bus.  There was only one seat available, and she reluctantly took it.  She sat down next to a man.  They fell in love on the long bus trip and now, they are happily married.  True story!

	<h2>Lesson 5: Education</h2>

		<div class="p1">
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p>Is school important for your future?  What useful things are you learning?  And what kind of skills will you need in your  professional life?</p>
		
		<p>In Sweden, some special schools are run by Vittra, a Swedish      education company.  Some of these schools are English immersion schools, so much of the schoolwork is done in English.</p>
	<p>In Vittra schools, every student is given a laptop when they start school at age seven.  The computers are used for doing homework, finding    information online, and learning.  </p>
	<p>Students are grouped by ability rather than by age, so classmates of different ages learn together.  This will help students to work well with  people of different ages when they start working in the future. </p>
	<p>Also, the school subjects are sometimes combined.  For example, when students do a project on the environment, they need to understand        science, economics, and politics.  Sven, a 13-year-old Vittra student says, “Our lessons are interesting and creative.  The teachers encourage us to  express our opinions.”   </p>
	<p>Sven’s teachers organize discussions and projects, but some classes are led by students.  In these classes, students can study what they are        interested in.  The teachers are more like assistants, helping students when necessary.</p>

		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<p>	In Switzerland, two thirds of students get vocational training at real companies from the age of 15.  By 19, they can be expected to start jobs with higher salaries than many Japanese university graduates.  Maria, 19, says, “I wasn’t interested in university.  Through my vocational training, I learned practical skills, and now, I’m starting my career at a bank.”</p>  
	<p>In other countries, many university graduates     go unemployed, not being able to communicate or work well with others.  In 2014, in European     countries, such as Italy and Spain, half the people  under 25 couldn’t find jobs.  But only three percent of young Swiss   people were jobless.  This might be because Swiss students acquire    practical skills during their vocational training.  Believing that they have a responsibility to society, Swiss companies train students and prepare them very well for the future.  
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p3">
		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p>How will the skills learned in Sweden and Switzerland help the students in their professional lives?  In Swedish schools, students speak a lot of English.  Being proficient in English will be useful in the        workplace.  Also, all the students have laptops.  Knowing how to find         and organize information on the web is necessary in our information age.  Choosing their own projects motivates students, too, and teaches them decision-making skills.  In Switzerland, since companies help to plan students’ education, teenagers get trained for jobs while learning how to communicate and collaborate.  Such skills will help young people not only to find jobs, but also to have successful careers.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p4">
		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>Should we change the Japanese education system?  In Gunma     Prefecture, an English immersion school was opened in 2005.  At this school, there are many subjects taught in English, and the students’ English ability is quite good.  But these students might learn fewer Japanese words, such as important scientific terms.</p>
	<p>Can all schoolwork be done on laptops in Japan?  In this country,  people worry that students are not able to write kanji well.  Also, according to some teachers, hand-written work helps students to learn better.</p>
 	<p>Can younger and older students study together well in Japan, a country with a strong senpai-kohai relationship?  In such classes, it’s      possible that some students might not feel equal.  Thus, they might find it difficult to express their opinions.</p>
	<p>Additionally, is the age of 15 too young for students to choose a   career, like Swiss students do?  Many Japanese high school students do not know what they want to do in the future or have enough information to make such an important decision.</p>
	<p>Education in Japan is at a crossroads.  Traditions, such as lecture-style lessons and translation in English class, are still being used.  The questions are:  What skills are necessary in the 21st century, and does the current Japanese education system prepare students for a very competitive global world? 
		</p>

		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>
	When <i>I</i> went to school, we didn’t have the Internet, so everything we learned came from our teachers and books.  Of course, we had to go to the library or to the bookstore to get books.  We couldn’t get information right away.  These days, students can get so much information with just a smartphone.  So is memorization of names and dates really necessary    anymore in this modern age?</p>
	<p>I think in ten or twenty years from now, education will be          completely different.  Math, science, and history will be organized into easy-to-understand software packages.  Most lecture-style classes will    disappear, and school will be used more for practice.  Teachers will help students with any problems and make time for discussion and creative    activities.  What do you think about this kind of education system?

	<h2>Lesson 6: Video Games</h2>

		<div class="intro">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>	Do you like to play video games?  Millions of young people around the world do.  For example, in the United States, 97 percent of kids aged 12 to 17 are gamers.  There is no doubt at all that video games are very     popular.  However, there are many questions about the positive and      negative effects of gaming, especially on young people.  The question is:  Are video games good or bad for children?  </p>
		</div>

		<div class="p1">		
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p><b>Jane</b> -	I think that video games are not good for children.  I know that there are many kinds of games, such as word games, sports, and puzzles.  Be that as it may, there are also lots of violent video games.  Some psychologists    believe that children become more aggressive by playing such video games.  Kids might think that it’s O.K. to hit and kick others, seeing these things in video games.  This is very worrying for parents and teachers.</p>
		<p>My husband is a physical education teacher at a local elementary school.  Sometimes, he sees older students bullying younger kids after school.  He thinks this kind of behavior might come from violent video games.  How do you feel about this?
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p2">
		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<p><b>Bill</b>  -	I think that video games are very good for children.  I am a parent of two young kids, and I am also a gamer.  My wife and I let our kids play video games because gaming can teach children some very important skills.</p>  
	<p>There are lots of word games with problem-solving tasks that kids have to complete to go on to the next level.  These challenges make players think critically.  Children can learn math, science, and        language skills while having fun.  It’s a new field called “edutainment,” education and entertainment.</p>  
	<p>Video games can also be used to teach children about responsibility.  In virtual pet games, kids take care of various kinds of pets, such as dogs, cats, and fish.  Players have to feed their virtual pets every day, or the pets will get sick and die.  By feeding and playing with their virtual pets,      children can learn how to take care of a real dog, cat, or fish.  Do you play any educational or virtual pet games?
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p3">
		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p><b>Sue</b>  - 	Some video games might be educational, but generally speaking, gaming isn’t healthy for children.  It’s very important for kids to go outside every day and play, do sports, and exercise.  However, video games make children stay inside the house.  Not getting enough physical exercise,    players gain weight, fall out of shape, or have other health problems.</p>  
	<p>My younger brother is like that.  Every day, I hear him playing video games in his room.  He is overweight, and his eyesight is not good. That’s because he usually plays at night, and he leaves the lights turned off.     Moreover, because of video games, he doesn’t socialize at all.  He never goes out with his friends, and he spends all his free time alone gaming.  I’m really worried about him.  Is this healthy behavior, physically and mentally?</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p4">
		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p><b>Paul</b> -	For me, the best part of gaming is socializing with people.  Playing video games with family members is a very good way to build strong relationships at home.  I play with my parents and older siblings, and this keeps us connected.  Without video games, we don’t spend much time together.</p>
	<p>Gamers used to have LAN (local area network) parties.  Such      parties were a good way to meet and socialize with other people in their city or town.  These people didn’t usually spend time with each other.  But through LAN parties, people of different ages and occupations met and had fun together.  These days however, LAN parties are less popular.	</p>
	<p>Now, online gaming is the best way for gamers to socialize.  This is great for meeting people from all over the world.  In the past, we only made friends with those around us, such as our neighbors and classmates.  But with online gaming, location is not important anymore.  We can communicate with people who live far away, and who have different cultural       backgrounds and ways of thinking.  This can expand our thinking as well as our knowledge of the world.  So, what do you think?  Is gaming for you?

		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>I don’t play video games.  I know that gaming is fun, but it’s also very addictive.  Once we start to play, it’s hard to stop.  I remember when I was a student.  I said, “O.K., I’m only going to play for 30 minutes.”  Two hours later, I was still playing.  Sometimes, I couldn't finish my homework, or I went to bed very late because of video games.  The next morning, I felt really tired, and I was mad at myself.  Do you feel like that sometimes?</p>

	<h2>Lesson 7: Japan's Changing Population</h2>

		<div class="p1">
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p>I don’t play video games.  I know that gaming is fun, but it’s also very addictive.  Once we start to play, it’s hard to stop.  I remember when I was a student.  I said, “O.K., I’m only going to play for 30 minutes.”  Two hours later, I was still playing.  Sometimes, I couldn't finish my homework, or I went to bed very late because of video games.  The next morning, I felt really tired, and I was mad at myself.  Do you feel like that sometimes?
		</p>
		
		</div>
		
		<div class="p2">
		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<p>Japanese men have also changed.  Have you ever heard of ‘herbivore men’?  Outside Japan, not many people know this term.  But surveys show that about 75 percent of young Japanese men think of themselves as        herbivores.  Herbivore men prefer playing video games, reading comic books, and enjoying social media with their friends to dating.  Many of these men have never thought about getting married.  </p>
	<p>Also, because companies these days are hiring more part-time and temporary workers, Japanese men don’t have the wages or job security that they used to have.  When a man feels that he cannot take care of a family       financially, there is less chance that he will want to be in a long-term        relationship, and even less chance that he will get married.  	</p>			
		<p>For these reasons, fewer people get married or have kids in Japan.</p>
</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p3">
		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p>How will a low birthrate affect Japan?  A smaller population needs fewer houses, fewer cars, and fewer services.  Businesses that give jobs to people and pay taxes might have to shut down, and Japan will have less money for education, health care, infrastructure, and other important things.  In small towns, as companies close their doors, young people will move to bigger cities to find jobs, making life for everyone more difficult.  This is already happening.  One example is the city of Yubari in Hokkaido.         Yubari's last coal mine shut down in 1990, and young people started      leaving the city, looking for work in other places.  The population of Yubari has fallen by more than half since then, and taxes from people have gone down.  Unfortunately, this is not uncommon.  It has happened in lots of small towns all over Japan.</p>
	<p>Additionally, life expectancy in Japan has continued to rise for the last 70 years.  In 1947, the average life expectancy was 52 years.  In 2014, the number rose to 87 years for women and 80 years for men.  This might     become a serious problem for the Japanese economy.  Money for pensions and health care comes from taxes.  But there are fewer young people   working and paying taxes, and more old people getting these benefits.  In 2012, a study found that Japan's population might drop to 87,000,000    people by 2052.  Almost 40 percent will be over the age of 65. 
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p4">
		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>What can be done to solve this problem?  There are two main ideas: Japan should help young people to marry and have children, and it should encourage companies to hire more full-time workers.</p>
	<p>For a few years, the government has been helping young people to get married and have more babies by holding matchmaking parties and by     giving parents money for childcare.  However, childcare is still very costly, and businesses don’t support families enough.  Japanese companies have been splitting families for many years by transferring employees, usually men, to different cities.  This makes life more stressful for everybody,      especially for working mothers.</p>
	<p>The government can also help young people by rewarding          companies that hire full-time workers.  For example, such businesses might pay less tax.  Additionally, the government can limit the kinds of jobs that temps can do.  Before 2004, companies had not been allowed to use temps in manufacturing.  Now, temps can be hired for almost any job instead of full-time workers.</p>  
	<p>Japan’s population problem has to be solved.  What do you think we should do?
		</p>
		</div>
		
		
			<div class="p5">
		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>I think that allowing more immigrants into Japan can help with the population problem.  Immigrants pay taxes and can do useful jobs, such as working with the elderly.  Also, some immigrants have children with    Japanese people, thus increasing the population.  In America, this is already happening.  In 2014, a report showed that more than one million             immigrants had entered the United States in the previous year.  These     immigrants pay taxes and have children.  How do you feel about this?</p>

	<h2>Lesson 8: The Olympic Games</h2>

		<div class="p1">
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p>	The Olympic Games were started in the year 776 B.C.  They were a festival for the Greek gods.  The name “Olympic Games” was taken from the place where the Games were held, Olympia in Greece.  The first Games had only one sports event, a short race.</p> 
	<p>Sports similar to those in today’s Games were later added, but with some interesting rules.  For example, only men could compete, and they had to speak Greek.  Also, the athletes had no uniforms.  During a race at the 15th Games, one athlete’s shorts fell off.  He continued to run and won the race.  After that, all athletes competed naked.</p> 
	<p>
	In boxing and wrestling, the athletes fought until someone was    either exhausted and couldn’t continue or dead.  Remarkably, one boxer won every fight without hitting anyone.  He just defended himself until his     opponents were too tired to keep fighting.</p> 
	<p> 
	393 A.D. was the year when the ancient Olympics ended.  At that time, Greece was controlled by Christians, who wanted to stop all other   religious events.  They believed that the only true God was Jesus Christ. 
	</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p2">
		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<p>	The Olympics were revived by a French man, Pierre de Coubertin.  Coubertin was very interested in physical education, and the place where he got his ideas was England.  There, he visited many schools to see how sports were used to build the students’ moral and physical strength.  Soon, he organized the International Olympic Committee (the IOC) to bring the world together through sport.  In 1896, the modern Olympics were born, with Athens as the first host city.</p> 
	<p>  
	In ancient Greece, winning was the most important thing, but for Coubertin, what really mattered was for people to try hard, compete in friendship, and respect each other.  Anyone could be proud to compete, whether they won a medal or not.  However, there were no events for women at the first modern Olympics, because Coubertin thought that no one was interested in watching women compete.</p> 
	<p>
	If we want to see how much the modern Olympics have changed since then, we only need to look at the sports.  Early on, Olympic events included poetry, painting, tug of war, and pigeon shooting - with real      pigeons!   We will never know whether Coubertin imagined such sports as judo, beach volleyball, skiing, and figure skating as Olympic events.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p3">
		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p>	Do you know where the first Asian Olympics were held?  It was in  Tokyo.  The Games were very important for Japan.  After World War II, Japan started to grow stronger, and in 1964, it could show the world the new, peaceful, modern nation that it had become.  This was symbolized by    Yoshinori Sakai, the 19-year-old student who was chosen to light             the Olympic Flame at the opening ceremony.  Sakai had been born in      Miyoshi, Hiroshima Prefecture, on the day of the atomic bomb attack on the city of Hiroshima.
		</p>
		
		<p>Tokyo was modernized for the Olympics.  Roads, train stations, and airports were improved, and new stadiums and hotels were built.  The Shinkansen, the fastest train in the world at the time, started only nine days before the Games.  But some people wondered if the Olympics cost too much.  In fact, the 1964 Games were the most expensive up to that time.  Still, almost all Japanese supported the event.</p>
		
		<p>The 1964 Tokyo Olympics were very good for Japan’s athletes, as well.  They won sixteen gold medals, including three in judo and one in volleyball, both new Olympic sports.  Japan finished third in the medal count,  behind only the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p4">
		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>The 1964 Games were very expensive, but they gave us a modern Tokyo, the Shinkansen, and Yoyogi Park.  It also showed the world that Japan was now an energetic country.  What has happened in other cities?</p>
		
		<p>  
	Sometimes, the Olympics have caused big problems.  The 1976 Montreal Olympics were poorly organized, and the city was paying for the event until 2006.  After the 2004 Athens Games, many Olympic venues were abandoned.  By 2012, Greece had no money due to the cost of the Games.</p>
		
		<p>
	On the other hand, the Olympics have been very profitable for some other cities.  In 1984, Los Angeles needed only two new venues for the Games, and the city made a lot of money.  In 1992, Barcelona was       transformed for the Olympic Games, with new beaches and parks, and  tourism to the city doubled over the next ten years. </p>
		
		<p> 
	These days, every Olympic host city has to plan very well for the  future.  The 2020 Games has a plan to make Tokyo more environmentally-friendly.  But most importantly, the Olympics will always be a time when the people of the world will come together in friendship and peace.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p5">
		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>	I wonder if it’s a good idea to have the Olympics in a different city every four years.  Because the cost of the Olympics is so high, it might be better to choose one place - maybe a Greek island - and hold the Olympics  there every time. </p>
		
		<p>  
	With a special Olympic island, we don’t need to build new venues every four years.  In fact, we can have the Olympics every year or every other year, and more athletes can compete.</p>
		
		<p> 
	What do you think?  Is the Olympic island a good idea?

</td></tr>
<tr><td>Patrick</td><td>So now you were home.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mozart</td><td>Yes, but life in Salzburg was miserable.  There were few opportunities, the musicians weren’t good, and my father was always looking over my shoulder.  I couldn’t stay there.  So in 1781, I moved to Vienna, the center of music in Austria.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>Patrick</td><td>How was life there?

</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mozart</td><td>Vienna was perfect for me.  It was the place where I found freedom.  I was free from my father, and I could compose my music.  Also, I was really impressed with the musicians there.  
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Patrick</td><td>
Were you making good money?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mozart</td><td>
Yes, I was.  By 1782, my income had doubled.  My piano concertos were very popular, and I was at the top of the Viennese music scene.  
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Patrick</td><td>
I’m curious whether your romantic life was also successful.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mozart</td><td>
Soon after I left Salzburg, I fell in love with Aloysia’s younger sister, Constanze.  I wrote Leopold saying, “Father, I’ve been thinking about marriage again.  Yes, it’s another      Weber, the middle daughter, Constanze.  She is neither ugly nor beautiful.  She isn’t witty, but she’ll be a good wife and mother.  She doesn’t need expensive clothes, and she does her hair by herself.  We love each other, so please let us marry.”
</td></tr>

No.  Again and again, I was passed over for an important    post.  Once, when the new Emperor heard a piece composed by me, he said it was too complicated; “Too many notes, Mozart!  I wonder if you could take some out.”  He didn’t understand music. </td></tr>

Around that time, he became very ill.  News came that he was dying.  I wrote back saying, “Father, I’ve been very 
worried since hearing about your bad health.  I pray that you’ll recover soon.  But please tell me if you’re not feeling better.  Don’t hide it from me.  I must know how you are so that I can go and be with you.”  He died in May of 1787, before I could see him.

	<h2>Lesson 9: Our Energy Future</h2>

		<div class="p1">
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p>Since the start of Japan's industrialization in the 1860s, we have used more and more energy.  Coal mines were opened, especially after the arrival of electricity in 1878, followed by hydroelectric power plants.  In the 1960s, the first of many nuclear power plants opened.  Then, in the 1990s, solar power started to become popular.  Today, Japan’s coal has run out, the use of nuclear power is very controversial, and most of our oil is imported.</p>
			<p>
	What kind of energy will Japan use in the future?  There are three main choices, and we might need a combination of all three.  We can use nuclear power, fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and renewable       energy (wind, solar, and tidal).  Each of these has good and bad points. 
		</p>
		
		</div>
		
		<div class="p2">
		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<p>	Nuclear energy is created by hitting an atom with a proton so that the atom splits in two.  This split releases more protons and energy.  The new protons hit more atoms and more energy is released.  In a nuclear power plant, the released energy heats water until it becomes steam.  This steam powers engines and generates electricity.  Using nuclear power to make electricity is good because the cost is low.  Also,  nuclear power is clean.  It does not pollute the air. </p>
			<p>
	However, there are some problems as well.  For example, nuclear        radiation can cause cancer.  Moreover, problems, such as not enough water, can cause explosions, as we saw in March, 2011 in Tohoku, Japan.  Before this time, thirty percent of Japan's electricity came from nuclear power.  But  after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, every     nuclear plant in the country was closed down for safety reasons.  If Japan   didn't have so many earthquakes, people would not worry as much.       However, there are lots of earthquakes, and if another big one hit, we could have a similar accident.  
</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p3">
		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<p>	After the nuclear accident in 2011, fossil fuels became much more important to Japan.  Fossil fuels are made from the carbon of plants and    animals that died around 300 million years ago.  Many countries wish they had large amounts of fossil fuels, but only a few do.  Japan doesn’t, so it has to import its fossil fuels from countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.   This is not good for the Japanese economy.  We would not have to import so much fuel if Japan had other energy sources. </p>
			<p>
	In the future, Japan might have a supply of one fossil fuel: methane hydrate.  There could be large amounts of this in the Nankai Trough, south of Honshu, as well as in the Sea of Japan.  Methane hydrate is a gas inside ice.  However, moving it could break the ice, releasing a lot of gas and   possibly causing a big tsunami.  Scientists are now trying to find a way to safely extract methane hydrate, but this might take years.</p>
			<p>
	Unfortunately, fossil fuels are very bad for the environment because they pollute the air and cause global warming due to the large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) which they release.  Methane is especially bad for the        environment.  If large amounts of methane were released into the oceans or into the air, we would have a huge environmental disaster.  However, if we are able to use the methane hydrate under the ocean safely, it might be a very important step towards solving Japan’s energy problems.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="p4">
		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>	Renewable energy sources (renewables) are much cleaner than fossil fuels and safer than nuclear power.  To generate electricity, we can gather energy from the sun with solar panels on the roofs of houses and buildings, in fields, or in deserts.  We can use the wind to power turbines on land or in the sea.  The natural energy of rivers and oceans or the natural heat of the Earth can power engines to create electricity.  We can use hydrogen to power cars and buses so that they will not pollute, and we can have clean air.  Many people wish we could use renewables for all our energy.  At the moment, these options are more expensive than fossil fuels or nuclear power, but with better technology, the costs will go down. </p>
			<p>   
	One more option is to grow trees and plants for biofuels.  Biofuels are made from plants such as corn, sugarcane, and palm trees.  This might seem like a good idea, but there are problems, too.  It takes a lot of money and energy to produce biofuels, so they might be worse than fossil fuels, economically and environmentally.  Furthermore, using land to grow plants for fuel means that there is less land to grow food.  The plants used to fill the gas tank of one SUV today could feed one person for a year.  Thus, biofuels are impractical, at least for now.</p>
		<p>
	Our energy future is one of the most important questions for Japan.  If we had not used fossil fuels and nuclear power in the twentieth century, we could not have built our modern society.  But if we had known about the dangers of global warming a hundred years ago, would we have done things differently?  What is the best way for Japan to get the energy that it needs?</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class="p5">
		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>
	I think solar power is the best way to get our energy for the future.  </p>
		<p>
	Wind turbines are big and ugly.  Moreover, because they are quiet and spin very fast, they kill many birds.  Hydrogen seems very clean, but most of our hydrogen is produced by burning fossil fuels.  And power from water or from the Earth can be collected only in special places.</p>
		<p>
	Solar panels don’t hurt birds, they don’t need to burn fossil fuels, and we can put them almost anywhere.  If every building had solar panels on the roof, everybody could get their energy from the sun.  </p>
		<p>
	For these reasons, I think solar energy is the best choice.  What do you think?</p>

	<h2>Lesson 10: What Foreigners Think about Japan</h2>

		<div class="p1">
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<p>	Have you ever wondered what foreign people think of Japan?  We asked four foreigners who live here about their experiences.</p>
		<p>

	<b>Sasha from America</b> - What I love about Japan is the safety.    America can be very dangerous.  We sometimes hear on the news about shootings, robberies, and other terrible things.  But Japan, which is a very peaceful nation, rarely has such serious crimes.  I know that there are some bad people here, and sometimes, trouble occurs.  Still, I feel very safe in this country.  In my opinion, safety is Japan’s greatest asset.   </p>
		<p>
	In addition to safety, I really like the honesty of the Japanese people.  I lost my wallet last year.  I thought that the money inside was gone.  I was just about to call the credit card company to cancel my credit cards when the cops called me.  Someone had found my wallet and handed it in.  I got it back with all my money and credit cards inside.  Unbelievable!

		<p><b>Yuheng from China</b> - I’m impressed with garbage collection in     Japan.  In this country, the days for collection of burnable, plastic, and      unburnable garbage are set.  Hence, people sort their garbage before they throw it out.  In China, few people do this.  The garbage is collected together and taken to the processing center, where plastic is separated from the rest of the waste.  </p>
		<p>
	I love Japanese dishes, especially sushi, but Japanese people think about food too much.  Many TV programs show people eating and talking about food, and there are pictures of food everywhere.  It’s a little weird.  Speaking of food, Chinese dumplings are popular in Japan, but they are eaten as a side dish to rice.  In China, people eat dumplings as a main dish.

		<p>	<b>Nameera from India</b> - I’ve been in Japan for ten years now, and I enjoy living in this country.</p>
		<p>
	One really good thing about Japanese people is that they cooperate with each other well and follow the rules.  Adults work a lot, and young people study hard.  I wish my son studied like Japanese children. </p>
		<p> 
	Also, I love how clean everything is in Japan.  We rarely see litter on the streets, and public toilets are usually clean.  Japanese toilets are the best.  The fact that the seats are heated, and the washing is automatic is great.  Sometimes, even the flushing is automatic.  I'm also glad that     Japanese people take off their shoes in the house.  In many countries,     people don’t do this, but the Japanese way keeps our houses clean.</p>
		<p>
	One problem which I have in Japan is food.  I’m a vegetarian, but it’s difficult to find vegetarian dishes in Japanese restaurants.  My friend, whose husband runs an Italian restaurant, says that many Japanese cooks and servers can’t understand the concept that some people don't eat any meat or fish.  In Japan, pasta often contains bacon.  A ‘vegetable sandwich’ sometimes has ham.  In other countries, that would be called a 'ham and salad sandwich'.  Once, I ordered a “チーズだけのプレーンピザ.” I thought it was safe because it said ‘<u>only</u> cheese’ and ‘<u>plain</u> pizza’.  Of course, it had sausage on it.  This is frustrating for me sometimes.</p>
		<p>
	Another problem in restaurants occurs when I'm with a Japanese friend.  I order in Japanese, but the server speaks to my friend, not to me.  Are the servers worried that I’m going to speak English to them?             Remember, I order in Japanese, not in English.  The same thing happens when I go shopping for food.  I pay.  But the cashier speaks to my friend, who is not paying.  It’s like I’m not even there.

		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<p>	<b>Lucio from Brazil</b> - I like living in Japan, but there are some     problems, too.  For example, I don’t look Japanese.  Thus, Japanese people       sometimes talk to me on the street in English, which is not my native tongue.  I’m happy that they want to speak to me.  But the truth is that my English isn't good.  When I answer in Japanese, I think people lose interest in talking to me, because they just walk away.</p>
		<p>
	I also think that Japanese people worry too much about little things.  For example, people here open gifts really carefully, so that they don’t tear the wrapping paper.  Why?  Are they going to use the paper for another gift?  Brazilians just tear the wrapping paper and throw it away.</p>
		<p>
	Hot springs are one of my favorite things about Japan.  We have hot spring baths in Brazil, but people put on swimwear.  I love the natural   feeling of Japanese hot springs, especially in winter, when it’s cold, and we are soaking naked in the hot water.  The problem is that it’s hard for me to enter a hot spring in Japan because of my tattoos.  In Brazil, many people have tattoos, and I have some on my arms.  I think that my tattoos are  beautiful.  They show my individuality.  However, many Japanese people have a negative image of tattoos.  They think that tattoos are for bad people.  But we shouldn’t judge people based on the way they look or where they come from.  Instead, we should think about the merit of their character.  It’s easy to close our hearts and minds.  But when we do that, we learn nothing.  If we can try to understand other people’s thinking and see things from their point of view, we will grow, and our lives will be much more interesting.  What do you think?

		<h3>The Writer's Corner</h3>
		<p>	One interesting difference between Japan and my country, England, is that Japanese people wear masks.  They wear masks when they have a cold or when they are worried that they might catch a cold.</p>
		<p>
	I understand this is healthy, but people can’t see each other’s faces.  I find it difficult to communicate with someone when I can’t see their face.  Do you wear masks often?  What do you think about them?
